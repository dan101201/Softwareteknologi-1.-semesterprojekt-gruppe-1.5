Almost like it was made a long time ago. Stone carvings can be found around 3 quarters the way up, forming multiple faces, staring deeply into your soul. The faces look uncanny and familiar, but you can't quite place where you would have seen it before. In the middle face's mouth is a door knocker, the handle seemingly made of ebony, with the hinges made of silver.";
